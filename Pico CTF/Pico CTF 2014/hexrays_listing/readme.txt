Hex-Rays decompiler in action - text listings
---------------------------------------------

These are disassembly and decompilation listings of a small in-house utility
used in IDA Pro.

stm.asm: the assembly listing
stm.c:   pseudocode listing

Please note the difference in the listing sizes.

Feel free to explore the listings. They have been created in the batch mode.
It is possible to get much better results with interactive human intervention.

Have fun!
