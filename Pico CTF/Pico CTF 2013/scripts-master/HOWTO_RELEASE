1) Build tarballs of base-files and fink, as appropriate
(see the srcdist HOWTO)

2) Release them via the SourceForge FR system. Do *not* send out
the notice emails

3) Create/update the .info files for the above mentioned tar balls
and add them to CVS

4) Clean system:
  rm -rf /sw /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11 /Application/XDarwin.app

5) Perform a fink bootstrap using the tarballs you created in 1)

6) Create /bindist (you can use any other path if you prefer)
and _move_ the .deb's from /sw/fink there. Note that you
should retain the structure, compare with the bindist
dir on the webserver.

7) Now _copy_ the finkinfo directories to /bindist. Verify
no .info/.patch files are missing.

8) Temporarily add unstable to fink.conf. Execute
  fink scanpackages
then undo your changes to fink.conf again

9) Copy /sw to /fink-image/sw (or any other empty directory). Remove
everything from the src dir, and all .debs.

10) Create an Installer-Package using the data from the old
binary installer (TODO: put these files into CVS, along with more
detailed instructions, or even a build script)

11) Now test the binary installer!

12) If all worked fine, you can now create a disk image with the installer,
Welcome.rtf, ReadMe.rtf, and License.rtf.

13) Release package tarball, fink-full tarball and binary installer via the FRS.

14) Update the package database

15) Send out announcement:
 * web page
 * email to fink-announce
 * notify FRS watchers
 * SF news item
 * Versiontracker
 * freshmeat
