(Originally written circa 2002 by Max Horn; revised in 2005 and 2006 by Dave Morrison.)

This is an attempt to explain how to use the binary distro related scripts in
this directory. I had to discover this on my own, so it might not always be
fully correct or complete, but it should at least help to start using them.

Note that these tools can and should be improved, they are not set in stone.
They are meant to ease controlling the binary distro, and that can't be made
simple & fail-safe enough.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment variables:

BDBASE
  Description:
    Set to the location where you store the bindist tree on you local HD.
    The online bindist will be synced using rsync against this tree.  Note
    that bdsync will probably not work correctly if you don't have the
    trailing slash.
  Example:
    /bindist/

BDDATA
  Description:
    The location in which these scripts and some auxillary files are stored.
    I.e. it points to your checkout of the Fink scripts module, subdir "bindist"
  Example:
    /Users/maxhorn/Documents/fink-cvs/scripts/bindist

SFUSER
  Description:
    Your SourceForge username -- used to sync the sources to the public binary
    distribution.  Defaults to the current dist maintainer.
  Example:
    fingolfin

(Added in 2005: we no longer store the bindist at SourceForge, and this
variable is obsolete.)

CURREL
  Description:
    The release number (or name) to place the dist under.  "fink-" will be
    prepended to this name.
  Example:
    0.4.0 (will make a dists/fink-0.4.0/ directory)

BDARCH
  Description:
    The architecture for this release.  (Possible values are powerpc and i386.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bdadd
  Adds a list of packages to the binary distro. These files are taken from
  your active fink installation. You invoke it with a list of package specs,
  similiar to the "fink install" command. An invocation could look like this:
    ./bdadd xfree86-rootless automake debianutils-1.15-4
  It copies the .deb files into your local bindist tree, so be prepared to
  have a lot of disk space being taken.
  
  TODO: right now the path "/sw" is hard coded into the script. This is not
  that bad since the bindist is always for /sw; but if somebody wants to make
  a bindist for say /usr/local, it's bad. Shouldn't be hard to fix.

bdclean
  ???

bdindex
  Creates index.php files in the various directories of the local bindist.
  They will be synced to the online version by the bdsync command, and 
  then allow there to browse the bindist in any web browser. Usually it is
  sufficient to run it once after bdnewrel.

bdlist
  Lists all .debs currently in the local bindist tree, for the current release.

bdnewrel
  Prepares a new Fink binary release, by creating the appropriate file
  structure. You call it with two parameters: the name of the new release,
  and the name of the previous release (this is used to shared old .debs
  without the need to recreate them).  A typical invocation would be:
    ./bdnewrel 0.4.0 0.3.2a

  After running this command, verify that all went right and that the tree
  it generated looks OK. You may also run the "bdindex" command just after
  this one.
  
  TODO: should be extended to automatically retrieve the .info files from CVS
  based on the release tags in CVS.
  TODO: should be enhanced to handle "crypto" tree correctly


bdscan
  Scans your local bindist tree using dpk-scanpackages, creating the Packages.gz
  files required by apt-get/dselect.


bdsync
  Syncs your local bindist tree at $BDBASE against the online one (you will have
  to edit it if your SF username is not "fingolfin").
  This will not delete files missing in your local tree from the online tree.
  If you have to remove things again from the online tree, you have to do
  so manually (for security reasons, so you don't wipe out by accident the whole
  online bindist)
  Note added 2005: This now syncs to the bindist at sancho.opendarwin.org.
  All the files are placed into the "fink" group so that responsibility
  for maintaining them can be shared by the members of the group.
  Also note: the source tree created by the scripts here is no longer
  synced to the the distribution: see below.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I make a new binary release of the Fink distribution?

A: Use the bdnewrel command, as described above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I add a package to the bindist?

A: Assuming your local bindist tree and the environment variables are setup,
adding a new package FOO to the bindist works like this:


# Copy over the .deb file(s)
./bdadd FOO
# Ensure all .deb's etc are uploaded
./bdsync
# Make sure the files are referenced
./bdscan
# Get the Package.gz files are online
./bdsync

You could do it with the last .bdsync call only, and that would be a bit faster;
but by using two calls, we ensure the online Package.gz files never refer to
files that are not yet online. Not really that important, but playing it safe
won't hurt here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Once the new bindist is online, how can I enable it so that people can
use it via dselect?

A: In the web CVS module, modify the "LATEST-FINK" file to contain the new
version. Then, ssh into shell.sourceforge.net and run this script:
  /home/groups/f/fi/fink/htdocs/update.sh

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE (added 2005): because the bindist is again available for browsing on
the web, we are using it to fulfill our obligations under the GPL.  The
source links from the bindist all point (on the webserver sancho.opendarwin)
to the collection of source files used by the fink mirrors system; thus,
the source is being made available.  However,  we also have a responsibility
to make the .info and .patch files which correspond to the binaries available,
and this is done in the finkinfo directories in the bindist.  Unfortunately,
these finkinfo files are not deposited automatically by these scripts,
and must be put there by hand.
