Test cases for stdin/stdout with commandline invocation.

Notes: 

  - multiPage option has been disabled whenever output is written 
    to stdout.

  - stdin/stdout tests have been don on Linux and Windoze 95,
    Linux tests are all ok, Win95 are not (see comments below)

  - tests on Macs are still outstanding (if there's any 
    piping at all on Macs)



1. Writing to stdout

  - resulting file will have header equal to basename of 
    input file and extention .pdf, except when --title used)

  python py2pdf.py --stdout <file>

  - ok on Linux
  - doesn't work with PythonWin due to limitations 
    with printing binary characters
  - doesn't seem to work from pure DOS



2. Writing to stdout, piping result to a file

  (comments as above, but filename will be file.pdf)

  python py2pdf.py --stdout <file> > file.pdf

  - ok on Linux
  - doesn't work with PythonWin due to limitations 
    with printing binary characters
  - ok from pure DOS


3. Reading from stdin 
 
  - does implicitly write to stdout

  python py2pdf.py -

  - ok on Linux
  - doesn't work from PythonWin
  - doesn't work from pure DOS (terminating input stream 
    with CTRL-Z, but doesn't print all PDF due to binary
    character limitations, it seems


4. Reading from stdin, piping stdout to a file
 
  - header is empty unless --title used

  python py2pdf.py - > file.pdf

  - ok on Linux
  - doesn't work from PythonWin
  - ok from pure DOS
